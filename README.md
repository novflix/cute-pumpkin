# 🎃 Cute Carved Pumpkin

> Because even pumpkins deserve a glow-up.

Are you tired of that carved pumpkin face staring into your soul like it's plotting something?  
Yeah, me too.

**Cute Carved Pumpkin** is a tiny, cozy resource pack that replaces the creepy vanilla carved pumpkin face with something much more *huggable*. Now your jack-o’-lanterns won’t look like they want to haunt you — they’ll look like they want to be your friend!

Perfect for:
- 🍂 Wholesome survival worlds  
- 🏡 Cottagecore builds  
- 🎃 Spooky-but-cute Halloween vibes  
- 🎮 Just vibing in Minecraft without jump scares

## 💌 Credits
Made with love, pixels, and a desire to be just a little less scared of pumpkins at night.
